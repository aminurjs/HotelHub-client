## About This Site

- About: This site is a React single-page e-commerce web application. It is built with react-router, Firebase and JWS Authentication, express js and MongoDB.

- Authentication: I have added login and registration features. You can register by email password and Google. An access token will be generated as soon as the user logins. Valid user will be checked with that token.

- User Base Data: No one else will be able to access what the user will booked. Even using his email, other users will not be able to access it. The user can give a review on the room booked by the user. You can't if you don't book

- Protected Routes: Some routes are protected, if the user is not logged in they can't see them, then he will be asked to log in. After login will lead to that route.

- Experience: I faced a lot of challenges while doing this project because I had to do some things that I had never learned before. However, I was able to gain some experience by doing the project.

## Thank You PH Team ❤️
